## Project
In this project, we investigate the transferability of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) across three datasets: two from computational pathology and one from animal classification. We will train a CNN on a cancer dataset and evaluate its ability to extract features from the other datasets without retraining.

The dataset can be downloaded here:
